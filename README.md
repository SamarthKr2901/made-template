#  **Pandemic Playtime:** Analyzing Twitch Viewership Trends During COVID-19.

## Main Question

1. Is there a correlation between the increase in Twitch viewership and the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic?
2. Whether certain game genres (e.g., multiplayer, cooperative, or single-player) gained more popularity on Twitch during the pandemic and if this correlated with pandemic-related factors.
3. Do certain demographics (e.g., age, location) engage more with gaming content during the pandemic?

## Description

The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns had a profound impact on various aspects of everyone's lives, including their entertainment choices. This project analyzes the behavioral change of people as they turn to online gaming and streaming in response to the pandemic's challenges. It also allows us the gain insight into the role of online entertainment platforms, like Twitch during a time like this.

We can do this by finding a correlation between the increase in COVID cases and hours watched/streamed on Twitch before and after the pandemic. If we do find a direct correlation between the two, it would mean that people did rely more on these methods of entertainment during the pandemic.

Furthermore, a deeper insight could be gathered into which genre of games and what type of people were the most affected.
